# Electronic-Products-Sales-Analysis

In this project, The Electronic Products dataset was used for analysis, and the linear regression algorithm was used to compare actual and predicted values. And also used a statistical model known as the simple moving average to predict the next month's sales revenue. 

This is a project done by me which is ment for self learning and enhancing knowledge over the Data Analytics Domani.
