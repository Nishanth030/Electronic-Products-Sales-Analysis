# Electronic-Products-Sales-Analysis

In this project, The Electronic Products dataset was used for analysis, and the linear regression algorithm was used to compare actual and predicted values. And also used a statistical model known as the simple moving average to predict the next month's sales revenue.

▪ Performed an in-depth analysis of the Electronic Products dataset using Microsoft Excel for meticulous data cleaning and 
  utilized the Python programming language with Jupyter Notebook as the primary platform for advanced data analysis.
  
▪ Applied advanced statistical modeling techniques, including linear regression algorithms, to facilitate a comprehensive 
  comparison between actual and predicted sales values for the dataset.
  
▪ Utilized the Simple Moving Average, a well-established statistical model, to forecast next month's sales revenue, 
  contributing to data-driven decision-making processes and demonstrating proficiency in data analysis and visualization.

This is a project done by me which is ment for self learning and enhancing knowledge over the Data Analytics Domani.
